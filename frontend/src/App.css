/*
App.css

This file contains the CSS styles for the React application.
It includes styles for the root element, logo, and card components.
It also includes a keyframe animation for the logo spin effect.
The styles are designed to create a visually appealing layout and enhance user experience.
The logo has a hover effect that adds a drop shadow, and the card component has padding for better spacing.
The read-the-docs link is styled with a muted color.
The media query at the end applies the logo spin animation only if the user has not set a preference for reduced motion.
The logo spin animation is set to run infinitely with a duration of 20 seconds.
This file is part of the React application and is used to style the components.
